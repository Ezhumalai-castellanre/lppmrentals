# Bank Records Storage Fix for Guarantors and Co-Applicants

## Issue
Bank records (financial information) were not being stored when saving draft guarantor and co-applicant data to DynamoDB.

## Root Cause
The `normalizePersonInfo()` method in `dynamodb-separate-tables-service.ts` was using a shallow copy to normalize person data (phone numbers, ZIP codes), but wasn't explicitly preserving nested structures like `bankRecords` arrays. While the shallow copy should theoretically preserve references to nested objects, edge cases could cause the data to be lost.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `normalizePersonInfo()` Method
**File:** `client/src/lib/dynamodb-separate-tables-service.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added explicit preservation of `bankRecords` arrays
- Handles both camelCase (`bankRecords`) and snake_case (`bank_records`) formats
- Ensures bank records are never lost during normalization

```typescript
// Explicitly preserve important nested structures like bankRecords
// to ensure they are not lost during normalization
if (raw.bankRecords && Array.isArray(raw.bankRecords)) {
  normalized.bankRecords = raw.bankRecords;
}
if (raw.bank_records && Array.isArray(raw.bank_records)) {
  normalized.bankRecords = raw.bank_records;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging for Guarantors
Added detailed logging throughout the save process to track `bankRecords`:
- Before normalization
- After normalization
- After sanitization

This helps identify if data is being lost at any step.

### 3. Enhanced Logging for Co-Applicants
Added similar logging for co-applicant saves to maintain consistency and help debug future issues.

## Impact
✅ **Guarantor bank records** are now properly saved and retrieved
✅ **Co-applicant bank records** are now properly saved and retrieved  
✅ **Applicant bank records** continue to work as before (no changes needed)

## Files Modified
- `client/src/lib/dynamodb-separate-tables-service.ts`
  - Updated `normalizePersonInfo()` method (lines 106-137)
  - Enhanced `saveGuarantorDataNew()` with logging (lines 1812-1842)
  - Enhanced `saveCoApplicantDataNew()` with logging (lines 1428-1456)

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Guarantor Bank Records
1. Log in as a guarantor user
2. Navigate to the Financial Information section
3. Add one or more bank accounts with:
   - Bank name
   - Account type
   - Account number
4. Click "Save Draft"
5. Refresh the page or log out and log back in
6. Verify that bank records are still present

### Test 2: Co-Applicant Bank Records
1. Log in as a co-applicant user
2. Navigate to the Financial Information section
3. Add one or more bank accounts
4. Click "Save Draft"
5. Refresh the page or log out and log back in
6. Verify that bank records are still present

### Test 3: Multiple Bank Accounts
1. Test with 1, 5, and 10 bank accounts
2. Verify all accounts are saved and retrieved correctly
3. Check browser console logs for the detailed tracking messages

## Console Logs to Monitor
When saving guarantor data, look for these log messages:
- `🛡️ Input data.guarantor_info.bankRecords:` - Shows bank records before normalization
- `🛡️ Normalized guarantor_info.bankRecords:` - Shows bank records after normalization
- `🛡️ guarantor_info.bankRecords:` - Shows bank records after sanitization

When saving co-applicant data, look for:
- `👥 Input data.coapplicant_info.bankRecords:` - Shows bank records before normalization
- `👥 Normalized coapplicant_info.bankRecords:` - Shows bank records after normalization
- `👥 coapplicant_info.bankRecords after sanitization:` - Shows bank records after sanitization

## Data Size Limits
The fix maintains the existing data size reduction logic:
- Bank records arrays with 10 or fewer entries: All preserved
- Bank records arrays with more than 10 entries: Trimmed to 10 (only if total data > 400KB)

## Backwards Compatibility
✅ Fully backwards compatible with existing data
✅ No migration needed
✅ Works with both new and existing drafts
