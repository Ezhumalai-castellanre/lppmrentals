### **üöÄ How to Set Environment Variables in Netlify**

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your site
   - Click on "Site settings"

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Click on "Environment variables" in the left sidebar
   - Click "Add a variable" for each variable above

3. **Add Each Variable**

   - **Scope**: All scopes (Production, Deploy previews, Branch deploys)

4. **Repeat for All Variables**
   - Add all 7 variables listed above
   - Make sure to use your actual production URLs for redirects

### **üîç Debug Information**

The application now includes debug logging to help troubleshoot configuration issues. Check the browser console for:

```
AWS Configuration Debug: {
  hasAwsCredentials: true/false,
  userPoolId: "us-east-1_d07c780Tz",
  userPoolClientId: "dodlhbfd06i8u5t9kl6lkk6a0",
  identityPoolId: "us-east-1:317775cf-6015-4ce2-9551-57994672861d",
  region: "us-east-1"
}
```

### **‚úÖ Verification Steps**

1. **After setting environment variables:**
   - Trigger a new deployment in Netlify
   - Check the browser console for debug information
   - Test the login functionality

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - `hasAwsCredentials` should be `true`
   - All AWS configuration values should be populated
   - Login should work without "InvalidParameterException"

### **üêõ Common Issues**

1. **"InvalidParameterException: demo-client-id"**
   - Environment variables not set in Netlify
   - Solution: Add all required environment variables

2. **"hasAwsCredentials: false"**
   - Missing or incorrect environment variables
   - Solution: Verify all variables are set correctly

3. **CORS Issues**
   - Add your Netlify domain to Cognito User Pool settings
   - Update redirect URLs in Cognito configuration

### **üìû Support**

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check the browser console for debug information
2. Verify all environment variables are set in Netlify
3. Ensure your Cognito User Pool is properly configured
4. Test with the updated configuration

### **üîÑ Deployment**

After setting environment variables:
1. Commit and push your changes
2. Netlify will automatically deploy
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Verify redirect functionality works
