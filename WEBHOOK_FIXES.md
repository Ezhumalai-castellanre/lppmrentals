# Webhook Fixes - Multiple Calls Prevention

## Problem
The webhook was sending multiple requests for the same file upload, causing:
- Validation errors (451.7 KB, 47.1 KB, etc.)
- Duplicate submissions
- Failed scenarios in Make.com
- Poor user experience

## Root Causes
1. **No deduplication mechanism** for individual file uploads
2. **Multiple FileUpload components** enabled with webhooks
3. **Immediate webhook calls** on every file upload
4. **No retry prevention** for failed uploads
5. **No state management** for ongoing uploads

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. File Upload Deduplication
- Added `ongoingFileUploads` Set to track active uploads
- Added `failedUploads` Set to prevent retries on failed uploads
- Unique key generation: `${referenceId}-${sectionName}-${file.name}-${file.size}`

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Track failed uploads to prevent infinite retries
- Better error messages and logging
- Graceful handling of timeouts and network errors

### 3. State Management
- Clear webhook cache when starting new applications
- Debug methods to monitor webhook state
- Reset functionality for troubleshooting

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Detailed logging for guarantor documents
- Performance metrics for uploads
- Clear success/error indicators

## New Methods Added

### WebhookService
- `clearFailedUploads()` - Clear failed upload cache
- `getUploadStatus()` - Get current upload status
- `debugWebhookState()` - Debug webhook state
- `resetWebhookState()` - Reset all webhook state
- `testWebhookConnectivity()` - Test webhook connectivity

### Application Form
- `clearWebhookCache()` - Clear cache for new applications
- `getWebhookStatus()` - Check current webhook status

## Usage

### Clear Cache for New Application
```javascript
WebhookService.clearFailedUploads();
```

### Check Upload Status
```javascript
const status = WebhookService.getUploadStatus();
console.log('Ongoing:', status.ongoing, 'Failed:', status.failed);
```

### Debug Webhook State
```javascript
WebhookService.debugWebhookState();
```

### Test Connectivity
```javascript
const result = await WebhookService.testWebhookConnectivity();
```

## Benefits
1. **Prevents duplicate webhook calls** for the same file
2. **Reduces validation errors** by preventing retries
3. **Improves user experience** with better error handling
4. **Provides debugging tools** for troubleshooting
5. **Maintains webhook state** across application lifecycle

## Monitoring
- Check browser console for webhook status logs
- Monitor Make.com scenario logs for reduced errors
- Use debug methods to troubleshoot issues
- Clear cache when starting fresh applications
