# Quick Fix for Amplify S3 Upload 404 Error

## Problem
You're getting a 404 error when trying to access `/api/s3-upload/` because:
1. Your Express server isn't running in Amplify
2. The Netlify functions aren't available in Amplify
3. You need an Amplify backend API

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Deploy to Netlify (Easiest)
Since your code is already configured for Netlify:

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. **Connect your GitHub repository**
3. **Deploy from the `main` branch**
4. **Your S3 upload will work immediately** with the existing Netlify functions

### Option 2: Fix Amplify Deployment (More Complex)
If you want to stick with Amplify:

1. **Install Amplify CLI locally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
   ```

2. **Initialize Amplify in your project:**
   ```bash
   amplify init
   ```

3. **Add API Gateway:**
   ```bash
   amplify add api
   ```

4. **Add Lambda function:**
   ```bash
   amplify add function
   ```

5. **Deploy backend:**
   ```bash
   amplify push
   ```

### Option 3: Use AWS Lambda Directly (Quickest for Amplify)
Create a simple Lambda function:

1. **Go to AWS Lambda Console**
2. **Create function** with Node.js 18.x runtime
3. **Copy the S3 upload code** from `netlify/functions/s3-upload/index.js`
4. **Set environment variables:**
   - `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: your-bucket-name
   - `AWS_REGION`: us-east-1
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: your-access-key
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: your-secret-key

5. **Create API Gateway** and point it to your Lambda
6. **Update your frontend** to use the new API Gateway URL

## Recommended Solution
**Use Option 1 (Netlify)** because:
- ✅ Your code is already configured for it
- ✅ All functions are working
- ✅ No additional setup required
- ✅ Better for serverless functions

## Current Status
- ❌ Amplify deployment failing (no backend)
- ✅ Netlify functions ready to use
- ✅ Frontend code working
- ✅ S3 upload logic implemented

## Next Steps
1. **Choose your deployment platform** (Netlify recommended)
2. **Deploy and test** the S3 upload functionality
3. **Monitor logs** for any errors
4. **Update environment variables** with your AWS credentials
