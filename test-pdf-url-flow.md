# PDF URL Flow Test

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Modified `generatePDF` function** in `application-form.tsx`:
   - Changed return type to `Promise<string | null>`
   - Returns the S3 URL from the webhook result
   - Returns `null` on error

2. **Updated `sendPDFToWebhook` method** in `webhook-service.ts`:
   - Added `s3Url` to the return type
   - Returns the S3 URL in all success/error cases

3. **Modified form submission flow** in `application-form.tsx`:
   - PDF generation now happens BEFORE webhook submission
   - PDF URL is captured and added to the webhook payload
   - PDF URL is included in the `completeWebhookData` object

4. **Updated webhook service** in `webhook-service.ts`:
   - Added `pdfUrl` field to the transformed form data
   - PDF URL is now included in the webhook payload sent to external systems

## Flow Verification

The complete flow now works as follows:

1. User submits the application form
2. PDF is generated and uploaded to S3
3. S3 URL is captured from the upload result
4. PDF URL is added to the form data payload
5. Complete form data (including PDF URL) is sent to the webhook
6. External systems receive both the form data and the PDF URL

## Testing

To test this flow:

1. Fill out the application form completely
2. Submit the form
3. Check the browser console for logs showing:
   - "ðŸš€ Starting PDF generation to get S3 URL..."
   - "âœ… PDF generated successfully, S3 URL: [URL]"
   - "ðŸ“Ž Added PDF URL to form data: [URL]"
4. Verify the webhook payload includes the `pdfUrl` field
5. Confirm the PDF is downloaded and the S3 URL is accessible

## Files Modified

- `client/src/components/application-form.tsx`
- `client/src/lib/webhook-service.ts`

## Key Benefits

- PDF URL is now included in the form data sent to webhooks
- External systems can access the generated PDF via the S3 URL
- No duplicate PDF generation (generated once, URL reused)
- Maintains existing functionality while adding new feature
